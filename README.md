## To create gitaction workflows

#### 1/ We add in our repo .github/worflow/test.yml

#### 2/ Add our jobs and steps then push the change to our remote repo

#### 3/ From remote repo, we can run our action, and see the result of our jobs and steps

## In order to run the jobs depending on each other, we need to add needs: [ the jobs that this job depend on ]
